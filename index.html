<h2>About</h2>

<p>NT-Affiliated is not a conventional recruiting agency. I stand behind the belief that talent is the magical ingredient that fuels innovative ideas and builds successful startups. A great idea can only go so far without the right mix of talented, driven people working vigorously toward the same goals. I don’t just provide resumes and candidates; I’ll be your Talent Acquisition Partners in crime, doing all the dirty work to find those rare gems, the people that have that unique blend of talent, drive and passion that will bring fresh energy, ability and ideas to your team. So, while you’re busy changing the world, let me be your Talent Acquisition Partners, it’s what I do best.</p>

<h2>Services</h2>

<h3>HUNT FOR TALENT</h3>

<p>Your company can’t grow without talent and we all know that good talent is hard to find. Let me hunt for the proverbial “rock stars” ninjas, gurus, A-players and rare gems even if those individuals aren’t actively seeking a job. I bring the right opportunities in front of the right people. I have an extensive network and we can leverage it.</p>

<h3>FIND TALENT THAT FITS</h3>

<p>I don’t just tackle the qualifications… I look beyond a candidate’s prestigious education and big name experience and recruit based on what makes sense for your company. By focusing on cultural fit versus resume strength, I’ll find you more than just top talent; I’ll secure you long-term, passionate people all working vigorously towards the same goal.</p>

<h3>TAILORED TALENT ACQUISITION SOLUTIONS</h3>

<p>I believe the best way to understand your company’s needs, is to be in the trenches right there with you. I’ll provide onsite support and work directly with your hiring managers to be your talent acquisition partners. I’ll create a tailored recruiting solution for your company, helping every step of the way, from drafting effective position specs to providing interviewing assistance.</p>

<h3>THE NITTY GRITTY GRUNT WORK</h3>

<p>Job postings, sourcing talent, screening candidates, negotiating offers, background checks, personality assessments, scheduling… we know you don’t have time for it… you’re too busy creating the next BIG thing! Let me handle the grunt work… it’s my specialty.</p>
